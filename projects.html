        Vehicle technicians examine crucial parts of the vehicle and fix problems to make sure they are in good condition and won't break down suddenly.
        The study was carried out by the researchers to evaluate the everyday activities and transactions carried out in auto repair facilities.
        Customers and car garages will both profit from the system's installation. 
        Utilizing the technology to run the company will help car garages expand and improve operational efficiency.
