        “Hello, my name is manju, and I’m a computer science major. 
        I have experience with several programming languages, including Java, Python, and SQL.
        I’m particularly interested in artificial intelligence and machine learning.      
        Last semester, I worked on a team project that involved developing a web application app for vehicle service and maintance. I learned a lot about software development processes and project management during that experience.
        After graduation, I hope to work as a software engineer at a tech company, where I can continue to develop my skills and contribute to innovative projects. 
        In my free time, I enjoy attending hackathons and learning about new technologies in the field.
